## Base Layer

**Legend**: Short dashes "-" indicate OS-specific differences, with macOS on top and Windows on bottom. Longer em-dashes "—" indicate a tap-hold configuration, with the tap function on top and hold on the bottom.

The base layer of the Tofu60 2.0 features:
- A standard QWERTY layout.
- Split Backspace for HHKB-like access to `\|` and `` `~ `` on the top row, moving Backspace down to above Enter.
- A Caps Lock key that serves double duty as access to the main function layer.
- Split right Shift for an HHKB-like `Fn2` key for access to a second function layer.
- Home Row Modifiers (HRMs)

## Caps Lock Layer

The Caps Lock Layer (CLL) is the primary function layer for the board, providing access to:
- F-keys
- Compose and Leader
- Navigation keys
- Quick access to frequently typoed symbols (`_` and `+`) used for coding.
- Volume control
- Screenshotting functions

It also brings core features and modifiers to within reach of the left hand entirely, eliminating the need for repetitive motions of the right hand between the mouse/nav keys and, e.g., Backspace or Enter.

The use of the Caps Lock key here provides ergonomic and extremely fast access to the layer.

### Left-Handed Features
The most valuable aspect of the CLL is bringing essential modifiers and navigation keys—Backspace, Enter, and Delete—within comfortable reach of the left hand, eliminating the need for awkward right-hand stretches.

Consider deleting the previous word with a traditional keyboard layout:
- Stretch your left hand down to the bottom corner for Ctrl or Opt
- Reach your right hand up to Backspace with your pinky

Compare this to the streamlined CLL approach:
- Press Caps Lock with your left pinky
- Hold `a` (macOS: Opt, Windows: Ctrl) and tap `d` (Backspace)

This method is not only faster and more comfortable, but also keeps your hands in their natural positions, dramatically reducing strain during extended typing sessions.

## HHKB-style Layer

This layer is a modified version of the traditional HHKB function layer. While the right-hand features and top row remain identical to the original HHKB layout, the left-hand side has been customized:
- Volume controls have been relocated from ASD (their position in the standard HHKB layout) to XCV for better mnemonics.
- One-shot modifiers have been placed along the left-hand home row to facilitate easier chording with navigation keys.
- The 'Leader' key has been assigned to the Tab position.

In practice, this layer sees minimal use. The Caps Lock layer above proves far more ergonomic and accessible for daily tasks. However, this layer remains valuable for one-handed navigation scenarios and provides easier access to lower F-keys compared to using Caps Lock as the modifier.
